## Woovi Challenge - Crud Bank GraphQL Relay
Woovi is a Startup that offer solutions on top of payments such as Pix and Credit Card.

Today we have two products: Woovi and OpenPix
- [Woovi](https://www.woovi.com)
- [OpenPix](https://www.openpix.com.br)

## Challenge
Our challenge is a replica of our day-to-day. The same consists of building a CRUD of a bank based on our technologies.

In addition to technology, the challenge takes you to immersion in a work routine at a startup. When talking about startup, understand that we are one because we are building something new and without definitions previously defined by other people. So our routine is to code reasonably well. But more than that, unlocking the business and making the best decision to deliver what the customer needs.
